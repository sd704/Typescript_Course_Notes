// Using Interfaces To Define Function Types
// A lesser known but nonetheless interesting feature of TypeScript interfaces is that you can also use them to define function types.
// For example, you might want to define the type of a sum function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

type SumFn = (a: number, b: number) => number; // function type
let sum: SumFn; // making sure sum can only store values of that function type
sum = (a, b) => a + b; // assigning a value that adheres to that function type


// Alternatively, you can also define the SumFn type via an interface:
interface SumFn2 {
    (a: number, b: number): number;
}

// It's up to you which alternative you prefer.
